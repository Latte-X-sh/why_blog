# Why blog

### Introduction
    - This is a personal blog. The aim of the blog is to help understand why things are the way they are. Why do we use Django or why do we use celery?
    - Giving a use case and the reason behind each implementation is fuel to building this product.
    - It is mostly my avenue to seek out other views and share my knowledge as well to various industry experts..
    
    - Why to me? Wope to all :3

### Project Setup
    - The project runs on the following requirements:
        - python3.12
        - Django 5

    - You can create your virtual environment to store the project requirements

    - Have a look at the requirements folder for more fine grained requirements
    - There is also a test suite powered by tox:
        - Tox is a unified service that powers the test interface in the current project
        - Check out the test.txt file under the requirements folder
